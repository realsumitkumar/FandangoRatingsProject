Overview:

In light of recent concerns about biased online movie ratings, is it really worth trusting these ratings at all? After all, the company that produces the rating system also profits from selling movie tickets. Might they be inclined to rate movies higher than they should, in order to boost sales?

Goal:

Based on the article published in FiveThirtyEight, to see if we reach a similar conclusion? We will be using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyse the data and determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.
